<h2>Sometimes chrome mark it as dangerous site because of register section, google security thinks it is asking personal detail.</h2>
<h3>In that case either open it in different browser like microsoft edge.</h3>
Or on chrome click on Details and then click on visit this unsafe site at the bottom.

You can see in subsequent screenshort that this website has nothing to do with personal data.
I just want to show the registration, login and authentication feature.
